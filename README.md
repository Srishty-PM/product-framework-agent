# Product Intelligence Agent — Framework Runner

A browser-based PM aid that runs a full structured product framework from a single problem statement. No installs. No sign-ups. Just open and think.

---

## What it does

Drop in any product problem statement. The tool works through 10 structured steps:

1. **Customer Segments** — behavioural segmentation, not just demographics
2. **Pain Points** — ranked by severity per segment
3. **Problem Statement** — crisp, structured, interview-ready
4. **Hypotheses** — testable, with validation criteria
5. **Solution Options** — from quick wins to category-creating bets
6. **ML Opportunity Mapping** — where AI adds real value vs. rule-based logic
7. **Data & Feature Strategy** — concrete features, cold start approach
8. **RICE Prioritisation** — scored and ranked
9. **Tradeoffs & Risks** — technical, adoption, regulatory, competitive
10. **Success Metrics** — north star, leading, lagging, guardrails

Then generates:
- **Interactive Prototype** — a clickable HTML mockup of the top solution
- **PRD** — a full Product Requirements Document, downloadable as Markdown
